        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello! My name is Brandon Blakeley, and I am a research assistant for the psychology department here at the University of California, Riverside.<br><br>

        During my time here at UCR, I've volunteered in a plethora of studies and experiments, mainly centered on the field of clinical psychology. Experiments that I've been a part of and directly contributed to, have most notably those that directly impact the refinement of the psychological services we provide at UCR. Whether it's how to approach sensitive topics such as dealing with death of a loving one, or PTSD brought upon by an life-altering event, I as an assistant help refine methodologies to approaching said topics with our psychologists. My privilege as an assistant in the department of psychology, is being able to work with our professors on researching various topics when it comes to exclusively clinical psychology. Whether it's directly handling the random selection of our research participants, or conducting the experiments themselves, I have amassed a surplus of knowledge working first-hand in these environments. A few worthy acknowledgements that I have received as result of my contributions to the field of psychology here at UCR, consist of the "Most Innovative Research Experiment" at a awards and recognition ceremony held by UCR to highlight the important contributions students have made to make UCR as competitive as possible against other research institutions.<br><br>

        Other than that, I have had first hand experience in a professional and classroom setting. In addition to my experience as a research assistant, I have prior experience as a TA for a multitude of different classes within the department of psychology. For said classes, I've been responsible for grading and teaching a sum of 400 students collectively, and was responsible for discussion sections and solidifying the topics and information students learned in their lectures, whether they were online or in-person. Due to having such a substantial role in a class-setting, I have an abundance of experience working with applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, in addition to mundane applications such as Google Docs, Google Slides, and Google Sheets. In a professional setting, I have developed and mastered communication, which I have utilized to communicate with both patients, and to write professional research abstracts and research articles, which can be found in UCR's scholarly database, "UCR Library." On the same topic, I have had the opportunity to dabble in the psychological aspects in the medical field, requiring for direct involvement in a hospital and clinical environment. I have garnered experience working and doing research in environments such as private practices,  hospitals, urgent care centers, and various shelters. Through such experience, I have developed a refined understanding of how to construct and carry out research, including collecting data and using my diverse knowledge in the various ways of random sampling patients and participants. 

All in all, I believe I have accumulated a grand amount of experience and knowledge, both professionally and casually, through my experience as a research assistant and TA in the field of clinical psychology.
